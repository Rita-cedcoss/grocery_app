            SPAR Hypermarkets in India is a result of a strategic partnership
            between Dubai based Landmark Group's Max Hypermarkets India Pvt.
            Ltd. & Amsterdam based SPAR International. The company started with
            one store in 1932 and now comprises of 12,500+ stores in 44
            countries across 4 continents. The success story of SPAR has been
            underpinned by a set of values that have guided the organization
            since its inception which was more than 80 years ago. At the heart
            of these core values is the commitment of SPAR stores worldwide
            towards Freshness, Choice, Value, & Service.

            SPAR India currently has 24 stores across 9 cities; Bengaluru,
            Mangalore, Shimoga, Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, New Delhi,

            innovative hypermarket in India, making a difference in the lives of
            teams, customers, communities and shareholders, Everyday! Freshness
            has always been a prime focus area and a competitive strength for
            SPAR. We have pioneered processes, practices, & supply chain
            techniques that help maintain and boost freshness at all SPAR India
            stores. We believe in offering the freshest of fruits, vegetables,
            fish, and meat & poultry products, sourced locally or imported, for

          <p>
            To uphold our value of Freshness, we introduced a 'Farmers Market'
            section where local produce is procured directly from the farmers
            and transported to SPAR collection centers. Here, the produce is
            graded and delivered to all SPAR stores within short span of time,
            ensuring freshness. We also introduced a section called 'Freshly'
            which provides value-added services to our customers. Here, they can
            get fresh fruit juices, salads, and other food items which are
            freshly made for them. SPAR India has always been focused on
